### Introduction

The aim of this project is to identify metrics and measures that can help the health services in cities to predict the public health outcomes. In this way, they can take a proactive preventive measures against disease. This study will focus on studying the impact of the health services in the city on the public health. This data is taken from PLACES site. PLACES is a partnership project with Center for Disease Control (CDC). This healthcare data is only analyzed for the year of 2018.

### Research Questions

I am going to use health care data for cities and census tracts which is maintained by PLACES. I will begin by developing a set of questions based on my hypothesis. The intend is to analyze and visualize data for each of these questions to get answers. The questions are as follows:

1. Does the city health services make a difference in how much a population uses preventative services?
2. Can City health services impact Healthy Behaviors?
3. Does the use of health services make any difference in the city?

### Key Findings

- Because a population's health insurance, usage of preventative services, and even harmful behaviors can differ throughout places, there is a chance (but not a guarantee) that they will be influenced by them.
- Negative health outcomes are linked to a high prevalence of unhealthy habits and/or insufficient utilization of preventative interventions.
- As a result, the research does not rule out the possibility that a city can reduce the number of strokes, coronary heart disease, high cholesterol, diabetes, and other adverse health consequences.
- The two variables that differ the most between cities are also the ones that correlate the most with a range of other variables.
- Failure to employ many preventative services is linked to a lack of health insurance. This lends some credence to the theory that a part of the population is deterred from using these services due to their high cost.
- Physical inactivity during leisure time is linked to a variety of unfavorable health effects.

### Limitations

This analysis has a number of flaws, the most notable of which is the lack of data pertaining to the envisioned customer city. I recommend that any small city look into the health issues that are now plaguing its population for additional research and more precise, accurate recommendations. The CDC's data can be used to create a model for future research. Interventions can thus be tailored to the specific health issues that a group faces. Missing values has an impact on the reliability of the results of the analysis.
